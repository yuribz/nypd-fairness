    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In Project 3, the focus of my work was to determine whether the NYPD complaint data contains any degree of racial bias, in particular researching whether the board would favor the White officers/complaintants in cases against the Black complaitants/officers. My findings suggested that there was a strong indication of racial bias in the dataset, but I lacked some extra information that would help me confirm such a hypothesis with a high degree of certainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, my task will be to create a prediction model on the same dataset of complaints to the New York Police Department. This time, I am curious to determine whether there is a more general degree of bias that is evident from the dataset by **predicting the board disposition based on the set of features such as ethnicity, age and gender of both the officer and the complainant, as well the allegation against the officer and the reason the complainant was detained in the first place**. This is a classification model, since it will be predicting one of the two possible outcomes (board favored the complainant or not) based on a set of features. The choice of variable reflects the factors that would introduce the degree of bias into the board's decision (age, gender and ethnicity) and also considers the non-biased factors that led to the decision in order to not create a model that is biased in itself and fails to reflect the more important factors that play into the board's disposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "For my baseline model, I picked a basic set of features that related to the personal information of the complainants and the officers. I had four ordinal features (complainant and officer ages, as well as `fado_type` and `outcome_description`; the first two were passed in as is, while the latter two had to be engineered using two `FunctionTransformers`) and four categorical features (relating to gender and ethnicity, these were encoded using `OneHotEncoder`). My model used `DecisionTreeClassifier` in order to predict `board_disposition` (which was binarized using `FunctionTransformer`, 1 for \"Substantiated\", 0 for \"Not Substantiated\"); `DecisionTreeClassifier` is a reasonable classifier option due to the problem being a classification problem with a set of features that could determine the board outcome. The evaluation metric is the accuracy score, which is reasonable as I am trying to determine how accurate my predictions are compared to the actual outcomes, as I want to see if my model is good at predicting the board disposition given the provided features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline model produced great results on the NYPD dataset, with the accuracy scores being equal to ~0.92 and ~0.72 for training and testing datasets respectively. It seems that the model overfits to the training dataset quite a lot, while also being able to generalize quite well. Still, there is room for improvement, which is the goal of my final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "In the final model, I engineered several new features: I binned the ages in order to consolidate age groups and thus decrease fragmentation. The idea behind this is that some age groups might be more favored by the board, therefore I decided to attempt to improve the model by binning the age groups. Another new feature was the binarizing of the `complainant_gender`. In the baseline model, complainant gender is One Hot Encoded because it featured categories outside of Male and Female (it included data on the transgender and non-binary people). I decided to add the binarizing with 1 for Male and 0 for Not Male because of the assumption that the board might be more inclined to substantiate the claims done by non-males rather than males, so I thought that binarization would make the model more accurate. In addition to engineering these two new features, I added the `outcome_description` column to this model, with it being made ordinal with a `FunctionTransformer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I stuck with a `DecisionTreeClassifier`, and I ran a Grid Search in order to determine the best parameters for the model. The best parameters were calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "{'max_depth': 5, 'min_samples_leaf': 10, 'min_samples_split': 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, after calculating the accuracy score for this model, it turned out that it performed even worse than my baseline model, so I decided to work with the default parameters in order to produce the accuracy scores of ~0.82 and ~0.73 for training and test datasets respectively. The depth of the tree achieved was 51, and the number of leaves was 4260.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to improve the model slightly. While the accuracy on the training set dropped significantly, the accuracy on the test set improved by ~0.01. I think this model is a bit better at generalizing to the never-before-seen data, but of course there are still ways to improve the model. I think that me binarizing the gender column and also binning the ages contributed to the improvement of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "As an aftermath of Project 3, I am concerned with the racial bias in the dataset. Therefore, I was set out to see if my model is based on the basis of race of the complainants. I binarized the ethnicity data for the complainants (1 for White, 0 for Non White) in order to make the groupings. My metric was using the recall value, as I measured the fairness based on how the proportion of correctly predicted substantiated outcomes for each ethnic group. In other words, I used true positive parity, which is justified by the notion that in a fair model, the board would be as likely to substantiated claims for White and Non-White complainants, so the \"Equality of Opportunity\" parity is reasonable to check whether the model reflects this notion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the permutation test, I picked 0.01 level of significance due to the relatively small size of the dataset, 500 repeptitions, and the test statistic is the absolute difference in recall values between the groups (of which there are only two); Null Hypothesis stated that there is no difference for White and Non-White complainants, and the Alternative Hypothesis suggested that there is a difference and the model is biased. The observed difference was ~0.021, and the p-value produced by the permutation test was 0.706, meaning that I fail to reject my Null Hypothesis. I cannot confirm that there is no difference in recall values for the two groups and that there is no bias involved, but considering the mathematical computations of sklearn, I have reasons to believe that my model might be fair, despite my findings in Project 3 that suggested a degree of racial bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This was an interesting project to explore, and a great follow up to the analysis in Project 3. I definitely could improve my final model even further, but I was greatly limited with the amount of features I could engineer from the provided dataset. Still, I believe I was able to fine tune my model to an acceptable degree, and going through a process of preparing, training and evaluating a model and its fairness is a great experience that will be helpful in my future career in Data Science."

For example, teens might be more likely to be favored by the board compared to adults, same with senior citizens. Therefore, binning makes total sense and might yield more accurate results.\n",
    "* The gender column is way too fragmented for the complainants, with values specifying whether the complainant is transgender or non-binary. For officers, the data simply states whether they are male or female. To make the model more precise and to make it more unified, I decided to binarize the gender feature: now it is simply checking whether the person, both officer and the complainant, are male or not (cis and transgender men are grouped together). The issue with this grouping is that non-binary people are grouped with women, which has the potential of introducing bias. However, the board might base the their decision on gender, and men historically have been more likely to get harsher treatment by law enforcement, so I believe it is reasonable to train the model to check whether the person is male or not. For now, in efforts to improve the model, I will create this binarization and will evaluate the resulting fairness later.\n",
    "* I added the `contact_reason` column, which specifies the reason for the officer/complainant contact (i.e. the crime that the complainant allegedly commited). This, in my opinion, will be main the feature that will lead to major improvement of my model, since it will contain information about why the complainant interacted with the officer in the first place, and harsher crimes might lead to the board not favoring the complaint.\n",

However, perhaps the usage of different metrics and approaches allowed for a more comprehensive look into the dataset. The sklearn model performed mathematical calculations that weighted all the features and made the best use of them, so I have reasons to assume that the model reflects the actual dataset quite well. Threfore, based on that, I can assume that the model is not biased, and, by extension, I have the reason to believe that the dataset of my features also doesn't demonstrate a degree of racial bias, at least with the features engineered for my model."
